was the final program for our java II class. I built off what I learned watching a few different tutorials combining approaches and then refined to try to follow the requirements of our program outline. It was initially supposed to be in javaFX but I was having a hard time making work in javaFX the way I wanted and I ended up implmenting it using swing componants instead. I missed a few requirements such as changing the balls direction based on where it hits the paddle as well as a continous game mode part that seemed like it contridicted the level aspect of the game. All in all it was a good learning experience and I hope to find time to refine it a little more in the future.
